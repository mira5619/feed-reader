# Feed Reader Testing

This is my submmission of Project: **Feed Reader Testing** for Udacity FEND course JAVASCRIPT TESTING.

It is web based application that reads RSS feeds. The source code were provided by [Udacity](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). The goal of this project is to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).


# How to run:

Download .zip file, extract it and open index.html in your browser, scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the tests.

The code I write is in Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js**.

To create this project I used Udacity lessons and forums.
